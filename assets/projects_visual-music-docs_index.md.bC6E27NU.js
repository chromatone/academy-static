It places them in a systematic relationship, and proposes that documentation should itself be organised around the structures of those needs.</p><p>Diátaxis solves problems related to documentation content (what to write), style (how to write it) and architecture (how to organise it).</p><p>As well as serving the users of documentation, Diátaxis has value for documentation creators and maintainers. It is light-weight, easy to grasp and straightforward to apply. It doesn’t impose implementation constraints. It brings an active principle of quality to documentation that helps maintainers think effectively about their own work.</p>',9),Z={key:1},I={class:"m-4 flex flex-col gap-8"},N={key:2},S={class:"flex mb-8 bg-light-200/50 rounded-xl flex-wrap gap-2 max-w-150"},E=u("h3",null,"Project is included in the program",-1),H=JSON.parse(`{"title":"Visual Music Docs","description":"Modern learning methods implemented as tools to visually explore and master music.
