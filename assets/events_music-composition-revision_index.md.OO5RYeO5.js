Meet Denis Starov, the author and developer of the system. He is building an interactive online visual music hub at <a href="https://chromatone.center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://chromatone.center</a> for more than 5 years. By now he&#39;s released 7 albums and numerous music videos and live streams as <strong>tsoop</strong>. And got there through research, design and creative revision of music theory.</p><p>All this experience and developments are condensed into a unique event format, performed for the first time at Glowfish coworking in Bangkok, Thailand, at 5 PM on Saturday, 23 September 2023. The format is a blend of presentation, workshop, and performance. Entry is free + donations are encouraged.</p><p>First we&#39;ll explore musical elements from basic notes to complex rhythms using our innovative web-apps. Then after a coffee &amp; networking break we&#39;ll enjoy <strong>tsoop</strong> live audio-visual performance and then walk through the process of creating such multimedia experiences step by step together. And if you&#39;re moved by the music, you might even find yourself in an impromptu jam session!</p><p>The event is designed for everyone. Whether you&#39;re just starting your musical journey or looking to dive deeper, our tools will help you easily grasp music theory concepts, from simple chords to intricate harmonies. All you need to bring is your interest in music and, if you wish, your favorite instrument.</p><p>Not only will you get hands-on experience with our visual tools, but you&#39;ll also have the opportunity to be among the first students to acquire Chromatone tutorship. No prior music knowledge is required and a just browser tab is enough to explore music as deep as you want.</p><p>This event is just the beginning of our journey. We&#39;re building a school of visual music thought and we welcome new participants to become our students and, eventually, affirmed tutors.
