We are open for participation and collaboration in any music projects.</p><p>Every Thursday at Pirate Bay we have a Music Geeks Meetup. Everyone, who is interested in any way of music, can come and share their passions with other curious people. We jam some grooves, share some ideas and thoughts and then try to combine all that into some creative output like a performance, a recording, a music instrument, or a whole setup of them.</p><p>The community oscillates, people come and go, but the format grows and builds momentum. So see you next Thursday at 7 PM at Pirate Bay!</p></blockquote><p>We&#39;ve had 35 weekly events throughout year 2023 and it was a deep research into many small and large topics of music in modern society. We were enjoying musical atmosphere and the openness to move deep into theory topics just because we were decidedly geeks in a FabLab, tweaking the rapidly improving Chromatone web-apps and leveling up musicians of extremely different skills, knowledge and quantities. 😅</p><p>Sometimes it was hard to being people into a new place, where you are also new to everything around. Sometimes it was hard to keep them coming to weekly geek events. Some decided to skip one or two. Now I think we should have skipped more by design. The frequency of musical connections goes as deep as any other rhythm and tone. But there was another challenge for me to live test the web-apps I was actively building at that time. And we successfully polished all the ideas to quite usable musical tools. Along with the quite established format of events, adjustable to any level of skills of participants.</p><h3 id="_3-hour-long-parts" tabindex="-1">3 hour long parts <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-hour-long-parts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3 hour long parts&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li>19:00 - 20:00 - Talk - preparing gear and discussing music</li><li>20:00 - 21:00 - Jam - trying some ideas, getting into the groove, exploring changes</li><li>21:00 - 22:00 - Create - creating some artifact for future to have some record of the journey we take into music together</li></ol><p>Now we know how to use these steps in any proportion.

The almost uninterrupted row of meetups is coming to the turning point. August 2023 is the last month Pirate Bay Phuket exists as a place to host free and open events. Quite rural island, especially during low tourist season can&#39;t compete with vivid Asian cities. Glenn, who mafe Pirate Bay possible, moves on with other projects in different places of the world.  It&#39;s time to collect all the experience we&#39;ve gained with all these weekly gatherings and take it further.

It may be an end for a FabLab, but Chromatone is just at the very start! There are so many features to add and bugs to fix in the Chromatone web-site code base. These so much to teach, to learn and to explore with visual music language!  And there are so many people to reach out and get well with. There are ideas and plans on how to move on with our Music Geeks Meetups in other spaces. Let&#39;s see how it turns out!

This a bit longer recap was shot at once and then edited by our new member - Alex, a visual artist, who can appreciate the use of color as a means to get deep into music. It&#39;s so cool to see how music inspires visual creativity and vice versa. And it&#39;s the main case for Chromatone - to be a way to get on the same musical page for people of completely different levels of knowledge and skill.

I tried to summarize the way these 34 meetups appeared for me and all the guests, who could get to Pirate Bay in these Thursday nights. It&#39;s a pleasure to have a 3 hour meeting with other people interested in deep music explorations.

First hour to set and tune everything up and get in a proper mood. Share ideas and explorations. And discuss upcoming music. Yes, from 8 PM the jam starts and people start exploring all the possibilities to make pleasant sounds together. Free exchange of motifs, grooves and progressions. Nice time to share instruments and explore new territories.

The second part passes in no time! Everyone easily gets involved into music and just loses any sense of time. Very soon the quest is not how to start, but how to modulate and stop the jamming process. But there&#39;s more! Once revealed, new improvised moves may find their place in a more structured performances of the final third part of the meetup. It&#39;s purpose is to make something, that has a distinct form. A beginning and an end. A verse, a bridge, a chorus. A modulation or a dance. No actual limits are imposed. Just creative bounds to make room for everyone!

Last 15 minutes are for the recap - shooting it on air. It&#39;s a way to fix the trace of all the emotions and joy that was experienced together. To share the knowledge with others in space and time. And to share music!

There&#39;s so much more to explore in this format and techniques. Let&#39;s see how it goes next! See you again!

The atmosphere was electric as Alex strummed his guitar, while Den skillfully incorporated his condenser microphone into the mix, effortlessly avoiding any pesky feedback loops.

Adding to the excitement, Nick joined in to experiment with an array of musical wonders. And then there was newcomer Alex, who we warmly welcomed into our midst. We introduced him to the mesmerizing Chromatone system, unveiling its secrets on how to learn music through a visual journey. With eager fingers, he embraced the vibrant synthesizer keys, infusing the air with his colorful musical ideas. Surprisingly, he quickly found his groove and seamlessly jammed along with us.

Our innovative introductory approach continues to evolve, demonstrating that anyone, regardless of age or prior experience, can visually unlock the world of music. It&#39;s a testament that delving into melodies isn&#39;t as daunting as it seems.

Eager to explore music visually? Join us every Thursday at the vibrant Pirate Bay in Phuket. But if you&#39;re more of an independent explorer, satisfy your curiosity at www.chromatone.center. Get ready to embark on a harmonious adventure like no other! Looking forward to meeting you soon!

This time we succeeded with both!

Tom played drums and bass on OP-Z through the SMK-25 controller and rapped about tropical island life. Gift used Playtronica TouchMe to throw bright funky solos. Denis used his new Line module to route tracks to the effects and make the sounds wide and thick. Together we had a very fun jam in D major and G minor too.

We also battle tested our new wireless in-ear monitoring system - just ran 3 kits of headphones through it. It opens huge possibilities for jamming with live instruments and while staying locked and synced. And there&#39;s so much to explore!

Back to jams and amazing new collaborations with passionate musicians! We&#39;ve had a super cool meetup with Tom, Alex, Nik and Niki. Explored different tempos, scales, instrument combinations. Played much with arpeggios and warmed up to rapping and singing, what a nice feeling does it deliver!

New music geeks are now in the community. Renat brought his Syntact and played us some deep kicks and risers and Pasha brought his Circuit and produced nice percussion and lead sounds. Also Nok, the opera singer and a vocal teacher, came by for the first time. We got some fancy effects on the vocal mic and she got the opportunity to improvise with her amazing voice and singing techniques. Alex played bass as usual and Denis focused on visual communication in this emergent music band. And finally we&#39;ve managed to record some nice demo track that you can hear it in the background. So cool to see Chromatone tools really shining in live action! ☀️

Recap
----

This Thurday we had an unusual meetup - it was all acoustic! No synths, no amplification - just us and things to make sound with! We used our shared guitar and ukulele enhanced with Chromatone color stickers along with percussion and steel tongue drum. The talks and jams were quite pleasant as we could deal with all the complexities of music communication via our interactive web-site, that could really help us navigate the Em scale and a bit outside of it.

We had a new visitor of the meetup - Andrew, who shared many interesting things about him using AI tools to produce commercial music and other useful info about his creative process. Many new ideas emerging! Let&#39;s see where it all goes!

We used the new GPU shader Chromatone circle to visualize chords being played by MIDI controllers to sync our understanding of the notes played. Check it out here: &lt;https://chromatone.center/practice/chroma/shader/&gt;

Alex brought his new bass guitar and just couldn&#39;t stop playing riffs and bass-lines. But along with that he got our friend&#39;s daughters introduced into improvisational playing on ukulele and arpeggiated synth while Denis was struggling with the controllers to make all that sound pleasant and evolving. And we succeed!

Our new Brazilian friend Priscilla learned how to play a C - Dm - G chord progression on the keys and they could fit together with Alex&#39;s students playing C - Am - F on ukulele. It was fun, yet rather chaotic. So no live stream this time. Only a recap with some specimens of the music explorations.

Priscilla showed us some modern Brazilian music of different layers. From [Heavy Baile - Maconha &amp; Pente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ok3fs_7LLw) (and [Game Face On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHfo7KGlaFE)) to [Mari Froes](https://youtu.be/8fMVHAXPZLM) and even [Ibã Huni Kuin - A Energia da Floresta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hGabTfaM0Y). We learned about [meditative native music](https://youtu.be/j8ObcKIh_hk), that&#39;s still performed in native at real ceremonies in Brazil. So much to explore!

## Live stream

We make these streams to deliver the idea of what may be happening at Music Geeks Meetups here. Feel free to come to the Pirate Bay next Thursday at 19:00! The format is very flexible and we can collaborate with people of any level of music and English knowledge. 

Bring your own instruments or play the public ones, get into small talks about your music passions or collaborate with other musicians in jams, production and other creative processes. 

You can come just to watch and listen too.

Last time we made our first music instrument - the single string bottle guitar and then had quite a jam with it as a bass and solo. This time we are going to upgrade it with a new string and a bent neck to have even more fun with it. 

Any visitor of the meetup can have a short talk about any of their interest in music and then we explore the topic deeper together. Eventually we come up with our next build idea. Compose a song, build a synth setup, or may be build some new percussion for us to play? Let&#39;s decide together! No music skills required. Basic English is enough to start. And yeah, the event is free! So if you’re interested in any way of music - see you among us this Thursday at 7pm in Pirate Bay, Phuket town.

1. We made a one string guitar out of an empty cola bottle. Learned the Bowline and Taut line hitch knots.

2. We&#39;ve tuned it to A and found places to play D, E and B on it and then jammed together around A. The chord progression was Amadd9-&gt;Am-&gt;Asus4-&gt;Am and all around it. It was quite fun!

3. Learned more about building up a mobile music setup. Explored the power of the newly bought common ground noise isolator.
