Comprehensive music tutorship platform that connects tutors, students, and musicians. It offers a range of features including private and public sessions, educational modules, projects and events, social interaction, and a rewarding token system.

Here's an overview of the data model:

1. **Users**: This table stores the information of all users, including tutors, students, and musicians. Each user has a unique id, a username, a password, and a role.

2. **Tutors**: This table stores information specific to tutors, such as their certification status. Each tutor is linked to a user through the user_id.

3. **Students**: This table stores information specific to students, including the number of tokens they have. Each student is linked to a user through the user_id.

4. **Musicians**: This table stores information specific to musicians, including the music they've uploaded and the playlists they've created. Each musician is linked to a user through the user_id.

5. **Sessions**: This table stores information about the sessions, including the tutor, student, date and time, status, and type (private or public). Each session is linked to a tutor and a student through the tutor_id and student_id, respectively.

6. **Modules**: This table stores information about the educational modules. Each module has a type (theory or practice), a title, and a description.

7. **Blocks**: This table stores information about the blocks within each module. Each block is linked to a module through the module_id.

8. **Student_Module**: This is a junction table that tracks which student has completed which module. It links students and modules through the student_id and module_id, respectively.

9. **Tokens**: This table stores information about the tokens each student has. Each token entry is linked to a student through the student_id.

10. **Projects**: This table stores information about the projects, including their name, description, and partner. Each project is linked to a partner through the partner_id.

11. **Partners**: This table stores information about the partners who sponsor projects and events.

12. **Events**: This table stores information about the events, including their name, date and time, description, type, and attendee list. Each event is linked to a project and a partner through the project_id and partner_id, respectively.

13. **Attendees**: This is a junction table that tracks which user is attending which event. It links users and events through the user_id and event_id, respectively.

14. **Badges**: This table stores information about the badges that users can earn.

15. **User_Badges**: This is a junction table that tracks which user has earned which badge. It links users and badges through the user_id and badge_id, respectively.

16. **Ratings**: This table stores information about the ratings and feedback given by users for sessions. Each rating is linked to a user and a session through the user_id and session_id, respectively.

The system works as follows:

1. Users sign up and create profiles. If they are tutors, they go through a certification process. Certified tutors are listed on the app's Tutors page.

2. Students can browse tutors and book private sessions with them. They can also attend public sessions.

3. The app offers educational modules for students to go through. Each module consists of multiple blocks that the students need to complete. Students earn tokens for completing these blocks.

4. Musicians can upload their own music and create playlists. Other users can follow musicians and listen to their music and playlists.

5. The app hosts various projects and events, sponsored by partners. Users can book to attend these events.

6. Users can earn badges for achieving certain milestones. They can also rate sessions and provide feedback.

7. The app has several automated flows that handle tasks such as awarding tokens, updating certification status, booking sessions, and publishing attendee lists for events.

This data model provides a detailed structure for the system and can be used as a blueprint for building the database for the app.
