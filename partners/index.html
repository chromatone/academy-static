Today, some developers and makers instinctively develop applications, tools, or hardware to solve their own problems when they arise. Thus, they learn effectively at maximum speed.

**We want this culture of hacking to become the norm in society.**

We’re working to **cultivate the hacker culture** for students, developers, and active citizens by building an **adventure playground** for creators to hack, play, and learn.

We believe in the combined power of active citizenship and lifelong kindergarten via the 4Ps of Creative Learning: Passions, Projects, Peers, and Play.

When creators build things, it strengthens their magic - their ability to learn and create across disciplinary boundaries, to learn in public, to be creative, and to help them master and hone their practical skills, such as software engineering or biology.

We rely on four strategies to work towards our goal.

- Help creators broaden their horizons and perspectives by exposing them to new technologies, disciplines, and problem domains.

- Create automations and open-source technologies to solve problems for each community. We aim to develop open technology in collaboration with multiple communities, and have widespread adoption by multiple groups.

- Connect creators and organizations via hackathons, open-source projects, game shows, initiatives, and meetups.

- Raise awareness in other communities through media and science communication.

When a creator takes the lead and collaborates with other communities, they can solve even greater problems. By connecting interdisciplinary communities to collaborate on projects, they are able to share resources, learn from other experts, and achieve their shared goals.

This inspires us to connect and grow creators and communities across disciplines by creating a Community Mesh, an interconnected network of communities with shared values of lifelong learning.

The incentive is for creators to meet their personal goals, for organizations to meet their goals, and for the wider community to meet their shared goals.

We aim to build a foundation for students and active citizens to solve their own problems, to be an adventure playground for creators to take the initiative in shaping our future.

### A possible future

We envision a future where anyone can create to solve their own problems; where students and active citizens have the resources and knowledge they need, are able to collaborate creatively, and create even more.

We wish to cultivate the **garden of creators**; a community of lifelong learners constantly discovering new horizons and perspectives, building open-source technologies, collaborating with each other, and raising awareness through media and science communication.

We envision Creatorsgarten as a leading hub for Active Citizenship and Lifelong Learning, a place where creators can come to learn new skills, connect with others, and collaborate on projects. Where lifelong learning is not just a possibility, but a reality for all.

We aim to bridge communities across disciplines to connect and collaborate with one another. Therefore, communities can come together to achieve their shared goals.

We want to work towards building a strong, autonomous, collaborative, and decentralized foundation for active citizens in Thailand.

### Who are we?

We are a diverse group of people who are united by our love for creating things. We believe that through the lens of creation and technology, we can discover the fun and beauty in everything around us.

We don’t believe in disciplinary boundaries. As we think that all knowledge is connected, and that by breaking down barriers we can learn more and create more interesting things.

We connect people through events, meetups, hackathons, and much more. We strive to create an environment where creators can come together to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

We stand for:

**Creativity**: We believe that creativity is a fundamental human quality that should be nurtured and encouraged. We believe that everyone has the potential to be creative, and that the world is a better place when we all express our creativity.

**Empathy**: We believe in putting ourselves in others’ shoes, and using our skills to make a positive impact on the world.

**Fun**: We believe that work should be enjoyable, and that every day is an opportunity to learn something new and have some fun.

The name Creatorsgarten comes from the word creators and garten, as in kindergarten, which means garden of children in German. We chose this name because we want to create a garden for all creators where they can come to create, learn, and share.

We invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and creation. Together, let’s create things."><img class="max-w-50" src="/logos/creatorsgarten.webp"></a><a class="p-4 flex items-center no-underline justify-center bg-light-700" style="flex:1 1 160px;" title="Glowfish" href="/partners/glowfish/" status="published" sort="4" url="https://www.glowfishoffices.com" social="https://www.facebook.com/glowfishoffices/" description="Glowfish offers serviced offices that are ready-to-use, meeting rooms that can be rented hourly as well as event spaces for holding seminars or other leisurely activities." country="Thailand" city="Bangkok" full_address="92/4, Floor 2, Sathorn Thani 2, Silom, Bang Rak" gmap_link="https://goo.gl/maps/AFEqrhuRJYtWeYVW8" content="Glowfish Offices first opened its doors at Asoke Tower in 2010.
