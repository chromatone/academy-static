## Where are we now

Chromatone is an international music education platform for everyone to gain knowledge and new pleasant experience. The knowledge is stored in the articles and apps, but it's compressed and dryed out to be light and compact. But there's so much to dive in! And that's where guidance may be incredibly helpful.

We're building from the ground up, educating ourselves and the ones who want to participate in the early development. While Chromatone is developed for more than 4 years it's still a long way to have it finished. It becomes more of a process of distilling and transfering knowledge and joy.

Chromatone as the music itself is totally international and doesn't rely on any language (except JavaScript ðŸ˜‡). Our goal is to create an international community of teachers, learners and practitioners of our visual music approach. It has already recommended itself in music theory educational video production and the time has come for it expand worldwide. Project by project.

## Where are we going

First step is to establish the convenient way for tutors to meet their students. Then educators will start creating their own content with all the tools available. In any language and for any age and any level of prior musical knowledge.

Second step is for all the visual music educated people to get gather together and play some amazing live music. Once you're in, you know it's a whole experience bringing deep joy of being in sync with each other! For that we hold meetups and other events. It's our testing ground for new music collaboration formats.

Third step is to make such musical gatherings a part of the new post-scarcity culture worldwide. Chromatone makes music much easier for visual people to learn and practice, so it enables significantly more musicians in any given place. So there's always someone to jam with! ðŸ¤© And give space for everyone to meet fellow musicians and improvise together for a couple of hours with comfort and ease of Visual Music Language.

The Academy is our growing community in action. The toolbox is quite ready and it's time to give it in the right hands! We are opening up Chromatone as a community network of visual music tutors and institutional partners enabling students to readily discover their own musical voices. The main goal is to share the deep joy of live composing music together. With everyone, who just would like to learn to play. ðŸª•
